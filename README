== Ruby-GitHub

Ruby-GitHub is a simple wrapper library for the evolving GitHub API.

= Usage
  
  require 'ruby-github'
  
user = GitHub.user('mbleigh')
user.name # => "Michael Bleigh"
user.repositories # => array of repositories
user.repositories.last.name # => "ruby-github"
user.repositories.last.url # => "http://github.com/mbleigh/ruby-github"
user.repositories.last.commits # => array of commits (see below)

commits = GitHub.commits('mbleigh','ruby-github')
commits.first.message # => "Moved github.rb to ruby-github.rb..."
commits.first.id # => "1d8c21062e11bb1ecd51ab840aa13d906993f3f7"

# these two lines are equivalent
commit = commits.first.detailed
commit = GitHub.commit('mbleigh','ruby-github','1d8c21062e11bb1ecd51ab840aa13d906993f3f7')

commit.message # => "Moved github.rb to ruby-github.rb..."
commit.added.collect{|c| c.filename} # => ["init.rb", "lib/ruby-github.rb"]

Note that the information is less complete in the 'commits' pull
than in the pull for an individual commit. calling 'detailed' on
a commit retreived from a 'commits' call will make a 'commit' call
for that specific commit.
